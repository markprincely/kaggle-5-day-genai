    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",

       "\n",
       "1.  **Model Architecture:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.\n",
       "    *   MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows for a larger total parameter count while keeping the number of activated parameters for any given input constant.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "    *   Trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n",
       "    *   Training was distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Training Data:**\n",
       "    *   A variety of multimodal and multilingual data was used.\n",
       "    *   The pre-training dataset included data from various domains, including web documents, code, images, audio, and video.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Training Phases:**\n",
       "    *   **Pre-training:** The model was initially pre-trained on the multimodal and multilingual dataset.\n",
       "    *   **Instruction-tuning:** Gemini 1.5 Pro was then fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "    *   **Human Preference Tuning:** Further tuning was performed based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Optimization:**\n",
       "    *   A host of improvements were made across nearly the entire model stack (architecture, data, optimization, and systems).\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary, the training process for Gemini 1.5 Pro involved:**\n",

       "*   Massive computational resources using Google's TPUs.\n",
       "*   A diverse and large-scale multimodal dataset.\n",

This full text response is useful both for human interpretation and for giving the model a place to \"collect notes\" while it assesses the text and produces a final score. This \"note taking\" or \"thinking\" strategy typically works well with auto-regressive models, where the generated text is passed back into the model at each generation step. This means the working \"notes\" are used when generating final result output.\n",

       "Okay, here's a breakdown of the Gemini 1.5 Pro model architecture, tailored for someone with a civil engineering background:\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Big Picture: A System of Systems**\n",
       "\n",
       "Think of Gemini 1.5 Pro not as a single monolithic structure, but as a complex system of interconnected components, much like a large infrastructure project.  It's designed to process and understand information from various sources (text, images, audio, video) and then use that understanding to perform tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Components (Like Structural Elements):**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Transformer Architecture (The Foundation):**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   At its core, Gemini 1.5 Pro is based on the \"Transformer\" architecture.  Imagine this as the underlying framework, like the steel skeleton of a building or the reinforced concrete of a bridge.\n",
       "    *   **Attention Mechanism:** The key innovation of the Transformer is the \"attention mechanism.\"  Think of this as a sophisticated load distribution system.  Instead of treating all parts of the input equally, the attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts when making a decision.  It's like a structural analysis that identifies the critical load-bearing elements in a design.\n",
       "    *   **Parallel Processing:** Transformers are designed for parallel processing, meaning they can handle different parts of the input simultaneously. This is like using multiple construction crews working on different sections of a project at the same time, significantly speeding up the overall process.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) (The Specialized Teams):**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro uses a \"Mixture-of-Experts\" (MoE) architecture.  Imagine this as having multiple specialized teams (experts) within the larger organization.  Each expert is good at handling a specific type of task or data.\n",
       "    *   **Routing Function:** A \"routing function\" acts like a project manager, directing each piece of input to the most appropriate expert.  This is like assigning a specific task to the team with the most relevant expertise.\n",
       "    *   **Sparse Activation:** Only a subset of these experts are activated for any given input. This is like only calling in the specialized team when their expertise is needed, saving resources and improving efficiency.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Multimodal Input Processing (The Material Handling System):**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is designed to handle multiple types of input (text, images, audio, video).  Think of this as a sophisticated material handling system that can process different types of materials (steel, concrete, glass) and integrate them into the final structure.\n",
       "    *   **Embedding Layers:** Each type of input is first converted into a numerical representation called an \"embedding.\"  This is like converting different materials into a standardized format that can be easily processed by the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Long Context Window (The Expanded Workspace):**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   A key feature of Gemini 1.5 Pro is its ability to handle extremely long \"context windows.\"  Think of this as having a very large workspace where the model can access and process a vast amount of information.\n",
       "    *   **Improved Recall:** This long context window allows the model to \"remember\" and use information from much earlier in the input, leading to better understanding and more accurate results.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Training and Optimization (The Construction Process):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Data-Driven Learning:** The model is trained on a massive dataset of text, images, audio, and video.  This is like providing the construction crews with extensive training and experience on a wide range of projects.\n",
       "*   **Optimization Algorithms:**  Sophisticated optimization algorithms are used to adjust the model's parameters during training, ensuring that it learns to perform the desired tasks effectively.  This is like fine-tuning the construction process to maximize efficiency and minimize errors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In Summary:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Gemini 1.5 Pro is a complex system built on a solid foundation (Transformer architecture), with specialized teams (MoE), a sophisticated material handling system (multimodal input processing), and a very large workspace (long context window). It's trained on a massive dataset and optimized to perform a wide range of tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Takeaways for a Civil Engineer:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Modularity:** The MoE architecture allows for modularity and scalability, similar to how you might design a bridge with interchangeable sections.\n",
       "*   **Resource Optimization:** The sparse activation of experts in the MoE architecture is like optimizing resource allocation on a construction site, ensuring that the right tools and personnel are available when needed.\n",
       "*   **Contextual Understanding:** The long context window is crucial for understanding complex relationships and dependencies, just as understanding the surrounding environment is crucial for designing a sustainable infrastructure project.\n",
       "\n",
       "I hope this analogy helps you understand the architecture of Gemini 1.5 Pro! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n",

There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
